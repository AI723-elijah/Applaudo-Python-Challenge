# Applaudo-Python-Challenge
The test project for scrapy
- python 3.9
- Scrapy 2.6.1

It is modularized app so you can edit some structured files simply and extend the whole scrapping e-commerce website very easily.


# How to run
You can install all modules for this project with the following command
'python -m pip install -r requirements.txt'

You can run the nike fetching as
'python start.py nike https://www.nike.com/t/air-force-1-07-mens-shoes-5QFp5Z/CW2288-111'

Then you can see the result in ./products/nike/

The same with uniqlo.

# Notes
The most innovative, creative and challenges here is to modularize the whole project and make the project flexible with whole e-commerce systems.
